Attention

Only upload the file "program.cs" for each exercise to Titanium. That is the file that 
contains the code you have written. before uploading it to Titanium, rename the file 
program.cs to FILENAME.txt and then upload the file. (FILENAME is the name that the 
each exercise has provided for each program)

For example after completing exercise 6 (InchesToCentimeterActive), 

        Copy the file "program.cs" to a new location (that way you don't lose the 
		original program.cs file). 
        Rename the newly copied file "program.cs" to "InchesToCentimeterActive.txt" 
        Upload the file "InchesToCentimeterActive.txt" to Titanium. 
        Repeat these steps for the other exercises.

Good luck,,

Write a program named **ArrayDemo** that stores an array of 10 integers. Until the user 
enters a sentinel value, allow the user four options:

1. to view the list in order from the first to last position in the stored array,
2. to view the list in order from the last to first position,
3. to choose a specific position to view, or
4. to quit the application.

Write a program named **TestScoreList** that accepts eight int values representing student 
test scores. Display each of the values along with a message that indicates how far it 
is from the average.

Write a program named **TemperaturesComparison** that allows a user to input five daily 
Fahrenheit temperatures that must range from −30 to 130; if a temperature is out of 
range, require the user to reenter it. If no temperature is lower than any previous 
one, display a message *Getting warmer*. If every temperature is lower than the previous 
one, display a message *Getting cooler*. If the temperatures are not entered in either 
ascending or descending order, display a message *It’s a mixed bag*. Finally, display 
the temperatures in the order they were entered, and then display the average of the 
temperatures.

Write a program named **CheckZips** that is used by a package delivery service to check 
delivery areas. The program contains an array that holds the 10 zip codes of areas 
to which the company makes deliveries. Prompt a user to enter a zip code, and display 
a message indicating whether the zip code is in the company’s delivery area.

Write a program called **DeliveryCharges** for the package delivery service in Exercise 4. 
The program should again use an array that holds the 10 zip codes of areas to which 
the company makes deliveries. Create a parallel array containing 10 delivery charges 
that differ for each zip code. Prompt a user to enter a zip code, and then display 
either a message indicating the price of delivery to that zip code or a message 
indicating that the company does not deliver to the requested zip code.

The **Chat-A-While** phone company provides service to six area codes and charges the 
per-minute rates for phone calls shown in Figure 6-25. Write a program named 
ChatAWhile that stores the area codes and rates in parallel arrays and allows a user 
to enter an area code and the length of time for a call in minutes, and then display 
the total cost of the call.

**Figure 6-25**
*Per-minute phone call rates*

| Area Code | Per-Minute Rate ($) |
| --------- | ------------------- |
|       262 | 0.07				  |
|       414 | 0.10				  |
|       608 | 0.05				  |
